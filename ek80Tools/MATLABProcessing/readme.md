# MATLAB Processing

This is the working repository for the EK80 processing. The majority of this code was contributed by Lars Nonboe Andersen (Simrad), Andone Lavery (WHOI), Dezhang Chu (NOAA), Art Newhall (WHOI), Gavin MacCauley (IMR), Matt Perkins (URI), and Chris Bassett (UW-APL).

Modifications have been made to streamline processing and make the package more universally applicable for different transciever arrangements and types.
