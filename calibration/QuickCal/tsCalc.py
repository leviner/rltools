    This module provides a function that calculates the target strength of an
    elastic sphere immersed in a fluid.

    Addition functions are included to calculate the target strength at a
    range of frequencies, provide default material properties for selected
    elastic materials, and to calculate seawater properties from measurements
    of temperature, salinity, and depth.
